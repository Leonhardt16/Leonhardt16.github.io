<h1 style="color: blue">One of the classes I am taking this semester is Calculus I. Unfortunately, engineering requires a lot of 
math. It really isn't my strong suit, and my wife thinks it's funny that I like engineering and design so much,
but I am not good at math naturally. It is something I really have to work at.</p>
<p><h2>My instructor is Eun-Jung Youn. This class is difficult for me, expecially online, because I can't sit down with the teacher and troubleshoot 
the problems. I watch the instructor's lecutres after the fact, most of the time on the weekends, and then try to apply
that to the problems. </p>
